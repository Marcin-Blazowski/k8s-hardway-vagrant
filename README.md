# Kubernetes The Hard Way On VirtualBox

This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way on a local machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant.
This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a Kubernetes cluster. Anyway the automation is provided: [Lab Automation](./docs/16-lab-automation.md).
The are for sure better ways to build the cluster. Please check out [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), or the [Getting Started Guides](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

### Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.

##### If you come into problems while moving through labs you can provision the whole environment with k8s cluster up and running as described in [Lab Automation](./docs/16-lab-automation.md) or try to use automation scripts mentioned in Vagrantfile.auto.

While the original one has some k8s components' versions hardcoded this one tries to use the latest version if possible.
Most of other differences are listed here: [Differences](./docs/differences-to-original.md).

> The results of this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready, and may receive limited support from the community, but don't let that stop you from learning!

## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is someone planning to support a production Kubernetes cluster and wants to understand how everything fits together.

## Cluster Details

Kubernetes The Hard Way guides you through bootstrapping a highly available Kubernetes cluster with end-to-end encryption between components and RBAC authentication.
